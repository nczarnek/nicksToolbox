1) Warning: Tried to combine class descriptions with incompatible names; output target indices may not match input target indices 
> In prtDataInterfaceCategoricalTargets>prtDataInterfaceCategoricalTargets.catClasses at 343
  In prtDataSetClass>prtDataSetClass.catObservations at 170
  In establishFeatureSet at 74 

I don't know why I'm getting this warning.  Nothing is shared between the classes, and it doesn't always happen...?


2) the size of observationInfo increases even though no observations were added

Hacky fix:
- only concatenate observations if there were observations present in the onDS and offDS
